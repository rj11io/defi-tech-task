    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: release
    permissions:
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "lts/*"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: npm run semantic-release
```

## Important Notes

- This setup creates GitHub Releases, changelog updates, tags, and release commits.
- This setup does not publish to npm.
- This setup does not publish to GitHub Packages.
- Do not set `cache: npm` or `cache-dependency-path` on `actions/setup-node` in the release workflow.
- Use Conventional Commits so semantic-release can determine the next version.
- If the project already has a published or released baseline, seed git with a matching tag such as `v1.0.3` before first run.
